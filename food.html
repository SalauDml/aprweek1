      <h1>Classes of Food</h1>
      <p>
        Nutrition plays a pivotal role in our well-being. Among the essential
        classes of food, carbohydrates serve as our primary energy source, found
        in staples like rice, bread, and pasta. Proteins, derived from meat,
        legumes, and dairy, are vital for muscle repair and growth. Fats,
        present in nuts and oils, contribute to overall health. Fiber, abundant
        in fruits and vegetables, aids digestion. Minerals and vitamins,
        obtained from various foods, support bodily functions. Lastly, water,
        found in fruits, juices, and beverages, is indispensable for hydration
        and life itself. üåüüçéü•¶

      <section id="Carb">
        <h2>Carbohydrates</h2>
        <p>
          These are composed of one or two sugar molecules. Monosaccharides,
          such as glucose, mannose, and fructose, serve as energy sources for
          cells. They have varying carbon atom counts, like trioses (3 carbons),
          tetroses (4 carbons), and so on. Disaccharides, formed by combining
          two monosaccharides, include sucrose, lactose, and maltose.
          Additionally, oligosaccharides consist of 2 to 9 monomers.
        </p>
        <p>
          These contain multiple sugar molecules. Starch, found in foods like
          potatoes and grains, serves as a plant‚Äôs energy store. Glycogen,
          stored in our liver and muscles, is our body‚Äôs glucose reservoir.
          Lastly, cellulose, a component of plant cell walls, provides dietary
          fiber and aids digestion.

      <section id="Protein">
        <h2>Proteins</h2>
        <p>
          Proteins: These highly complex substances are present in all living
          organisms. They play a crucial role in the chemical processes
          essential for life. Chemists recognized their importance in the early
          19th century, coining the term ‚Äúprotein‚Äù from the Greek word
          ‚Äúpr≈çteios,‚Äù meaning ‚Äúholding first place.‚Äù Proteins are
          species-specific and organ-specific. Within a single organism, muscle
          proteins differ from those in the brain and liver. A protein molecule
          is significantly larger than sugar or salt molecules, consisting of
          many amino acids linked together like beads on a string. There are
          approximately 20 naturally occurring amino acids in proteins. Although
          we can‚Äôt fully explain all protein functions from their amino acid
          sequences, established correlations between structure and function
          arise from the properties of these amino acids1.
        </p>
        <p>
          Proteins contain carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur. Their
          large, complex molecules form twisted and folded strands of amino
          acids. These amino acids are the building blocks of proteins. While
          plants can synthesize all amino acids, animals cannot, even though all
          amino acids are essential for life. Legumes, such as beans, lentils,
          and peas, are rich in protein and contain many essential amino acids.
          Proteins perform vital functions in organisms, making them
          indispensable for our health and well-being

      <section id="Fats and Oils">
        <h2>Fats and Oils</h2>
        <p>
          Fats and oils are essential components of a balanced diet, providing
          energy and supporting various bodily functions. Fats are composed of
          fatty acids, with saturated fats being solid at room temperature and
          found mainly in animal products like butter and red meat. These fats,
          while necessary in moderation, can contribute to elevated cholesterol
          levels when consumed excessively. Unsaturated fats, on the other hand,
          are liquid at room temperature and primarily come from plant sources
          like olive oil, nuts, and avocados. These fats are beneficial for
          heart health, helping to lower LDL (bad) cholesterol levels and reduce
          the risk of cardiovascular diseases.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oils, derived from plants or seeds, are primarily composed of
          unsaturated fats and serve numerous culinary and nutritional purposes.
          Olive oil, a staple of the Mediterranean diet, is renowned for its
          high levels of monounsaturated fats, which have been linked to
          improved heart health and reduced inflammation. Other oils, such as
          canola oil and soybean oil, are rich in polyunsaturated fats,
          including omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, which are essential for
          brain function and overall well-being. While oils are calorie-dense
          and should be consumed in moderation, they add flavor, texture, and
          nutritional value to foods, making them an integral part of a balanced
          diet.

      <section id="Minerals">
        <h2>Minerals</h2>
        <p>
          Minerals are essential nutrients required in small amounts by the body
          for various physiological functions. They include calcium, iron,
          potassium, and zinc, among others, crucial for bone health, oxygen
          transport, nerve function, and immune support.
        </p>
        <p>
          Minerals are inorganic nutrients vital for maintaining bodily
          functions and overall health. Calcium, abundant in dairy products like
          milk and yogurt, supports bone density and muscle function, while
          iron, found in red meat and leafy greens, is essential for oxygen
          transport in the blood. Potassium, prevalent in bananas and sweet
          potatoes, regulates fluid balance and nerve signaling, contributing to
          healthy blood pressure levels. Zinc, present in oysters and beef,
          plays a crucial role in immune function, wound healing, and DNA
          synthesis. These minerals, among others, are essential for optimal
          physiological functioning and must be obtained through a balanced
          diet.

      <section id="Vitamin">
        <h2>Vitamins</h2>
        <p>
          Vitamins are organic compounds necessary for metabolic processes and
          overall health. They include vitamins A, C, D, E, and K, as well as
          the B-complex vitamins. Each vitamin serves unique roles, such as
          vision maintenance, collagen formation, calcium absorption,
          antioxidant protection, and energy production.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vitamins are organic compounds essential for various bodily functions,
          from immune system support to energy production. For instance, vitamin
          C, found abundantly in citrus fruits and strawberries, boosts immune
          function and aids in collagen synthesis for healthy skin. Vitamin D,
          synthesized by the body when exposed to sunlight and found in fatty
          fish like salmon, is crucial for calcium absorption, promoting strong
          bones and teeth. B vitamins, such as folate in leafy greens and
          vitamin B12 in animal products, are vital for nerve function and red
          blood cell production, playing a critical role in overall metabolism
          and energy production.

      <section id="Fiber">
        <h2>Fiber</h2>
        <p>
          Fiber refers to plant-based carbohydrates that the body can't digest.
          It comes in two forms: soluble and insoluble. Soluble fiber, found in
          oats, beans, and fruits, helps lower cholesterol and regulate blood
          sugar. Insoluble fiber, present in wheat bran and vegetables, promotes
          healthy digestion and prevents constipation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fiber is a vital component of a balanced diet, contributing to overall
          digestive health and well-being. It adds bulk to stools, facilitating
          regular bowel movements and preventing constipation. Additionally,
          fiber promotes satiety, aiding weight management by helping
          individuals feel full for longer periods. Diets rich in fiber are
          associated with a lower risk of chronic diseases, including heart
          disease, diabetes, and certain cancers. Increasing fiber intake
          through whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and legumes is key to
          maintaining optimal health and supporting a thriving gut microbiome.
